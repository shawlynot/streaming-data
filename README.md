# shawlynot streaming-data

Just some experiments with Python and C++

## TODO

1. Ingest historical second aggregates into DB from flat file API ✅
2. Build Harness
3. Event driven: read data, solve for IV?
4. Forecast with GARCH(1,1) and compare
5. Draw some graphs (yes obviously there's no alpha here)
